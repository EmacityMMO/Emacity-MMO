            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you
                visit or make a purchase from emacitymmoinc.com.
                PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br><br>

                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
                information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
                your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages
                or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about
                how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                Information”.
                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
                - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous
                unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
                http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
                - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser
                type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you
                browse the Site.<br><br>

                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
                Information and Order Information.
                HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br><br>

                We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
                particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
                generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the
                success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).<br><br>

                We store any verification information we collect in an encrypted file. We do not use this information
                UNLESS you breach our terms and conditions, or your promissory note.
                CHANGES<br><br>

                We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our
                practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.<br><br>

                CONTACT US<br><br>
